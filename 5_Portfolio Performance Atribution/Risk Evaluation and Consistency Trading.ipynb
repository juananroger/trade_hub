    "# Part III – Risk Evaluation and Consistency Testing\n",
    "This section addresses practical risk validation after model signals are generated and trades are submitted. The focus is on ensuring the system's execution remains aligned with expectations and does not drift materially from the intended portfolio state. While the proposed checklist includes infrastructure-heavy elements suited for production environments, we will focus on those tasks that are feasible and directly relevant to our current live deployment pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 11. Cross-checking performance between Zipline and IB \n",
    "To evaluate whether the strategy behaves as expected in a live environment, we compare daily and cumulative performance between the model and what was actually executed in the Interactive Brokers account. This includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "We run the full Zipline Reloaded backtest each day from a fixed start date (2025-08-15) up to the current session(2025-08-18), using updated EOD prices. From this, we extract the model’s NAV and daily returns. Separately, we extract NAV and realized returns from the IB account, based on confirmed trades and reported cash flows.\n",
    "\n",
    "From both sources, we compute daily return drift (the percent difference between model and live return) and cumulative NAV drift (the divergence in total equity over time). This allows us to catch mismatches due to missed orders, slippage, or rounding effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also compare these results at the individual contract level. For each futures symbol in the portfolio, we track return and NAV drift independently. This helps pinpoint where the largest deviations are coming from—whether from volatility in a single contract, execution errors, or incorrect sizing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alongside drift analysis, we generate a performance report that includes key metrics over the tracking period. These include annualized return, cumulative return, volatility, and drawdowns, as well as Sharpe, Sortino, Calmar, and Omega ratios. Additional descriptive stats like skew, kurtosis, tail ratio, and daily VaR are also reported. Finally, alpha and beta to a reference index are included to benchmark relative risk-adjusted performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "This output serves as a practical diagnostic tool because it ensures that live execution is tracking the model closely enough to maintain confidence in the system, and it highlights when and where manual review is required.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 11.1. Live NAV Logging from Interactive Brokers\n",
    "\n",
    "To verify that the strategy behaves as expected in live deployment, we log the daily Net Asset Value (NAV) directly from the Interactive Brokers account. The aim is to compare this value with the NAV produced by the model each day, allowing us to detect divergence due to slippage, fills, fees, or logic mismatch.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each day after market close, we query two pieces of information from the IB account:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. NetLiquidation in EUR – the total account value in EUR as the IB account is created in Europe and we cannot choose the base currency.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. EUR.USD FX Rate – to convert NAV into USD, matching the model's denomination.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once both values are retrieved, we compute the USD NAV and log it to a CSV file (`ib_nav_log.csv`) along with the timestamp and the FX rate used. If there’s a previous NAV entry, we also calculate the daily percentage change (`drift`). This lets us compare daily returns from the broker with what the model expects."

    "The difference between the two outputs arises because Interactive Brokers only reports positions that are already filled. Orders that are submitted but not executed — for example, because the market was closed or the limit price was not reached — do not appear in the position list. Once executed, the position will appear. If the market moves away from the limit price, the order remains pending until adjusted or canceled.\n",
    "This closes the loop between backtest and the live account. If the strategy logic is consistent and market structure unchanged, the two views should align over time. Any differences can then be measured directly instead of assumed.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a final note, full containerization of the execution pipeline will not be implemented at this stage. The system depends on Interactive Brokers’ TWS/Gateway for API connectivity, which does not run reliably in headless environments like Docker without workarounds. In addition, Zipline Reloaded requires daily ingestion of the full Norgate data bundle, which makes container orchestration inefficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, the pipeline is modularized into scripts for ingestion, backtest, signal extraction, and order generation. These can be scheduled individually with a task scheduler or run manually after market close to maintain control and avoid unintended live order flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "For data storage, we are working directly with daily-exported bundles from Norgate. While this approach is simple and sufficient for development and execution, it has limitations: sensitivity to schema changes. A longer-term plan is to introduce a dedicated securities database (e.g., MySQL or PostgreSQL). This would decouple ingestion from model execution, simplify metadata handling (sector tags, tick sizes, contract specifications), and provide consistent access across tools. For now, given the limited scope of assets and data, the current approach remains acceptable and easy to inspect during the buildout phase."
