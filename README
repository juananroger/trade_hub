This project documents the development and implementation of a systematic trading framework built around distinct strategy types:  mean-reversion, trend-following, term-structure, and momentum strategies. The focus is on futures and options markets, where contract structure, leverage, and liquidity offer a practical foundation for model deployment and risk management.

Rather than optimizing for backtest performance, the strategies are built with an emphasis on robustness, capital efficiency, and operational viability. Preference is given to simple, testable rules that align with observable market behavior, without overfitting.

Simulations are run using Zipline Reloaded for futures and OptionSuite for options, providing a Python-based research environment capable of handling daily futures data, expiration logic, contract rolling, and options-specific dynamics. Futures data is sourced from Norgate, selected for its quality and survivorship-bias-free structure, while options data is sourced from IVolatility, providing market-consistent implied volatility surfaces and related metrics.

All strategies target comparable risk per market via volatility normalization, with position sizing guided by a Kelly criterion based on estimated edge and risk.

The framework supports automatic rolling, dynamic rebalancing, and a consistent risk budget across instruments. This report presents the rationale, design, and implementation details for each component, along with performance results and visual outputs. The aim is to demonstrate not just how the models work, but how to implement it in a demo or real Interactive Brokers account.
