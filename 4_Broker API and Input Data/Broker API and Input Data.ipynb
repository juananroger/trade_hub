    "## Part II: Broker API and Input data\n",
    "To move from backtest to execution, signals must be converted into broker-formated orders. This involves identifying entries and exits, sizing positions, and ensuring all orders respect risk limits. This section describes the workflow that connects the backtesting engine to a broker for live trading.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use a daily cycle: signals are generated after the market close, checked against current data, and exported in a broker-compatible format for execution on the following session.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 10. Broker Integration and Trade Deployment Workflow\n",
    "A daily process links Zipline Reloaded with Interactive Brokers (IB) via the TWS Basket Trader. The script runs after the close, using updated end-of-day data from Norgate. It identifies new trades, applies sizing and validation rules, and exports the results as a structured CSV file.\n",
    "\n",
    "For portfolios with 70+ futures contracts, this avoids manual entry while still allowing pre-trade review. Each row in the file specifies trade direction, quantity, symbol, expiry, exchange, limit price, and other required fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "This fits the end-of-day model: new data is processed, signals are evaluated, and the system outputs a complete trade list. The workflow leaves room for discretionary checks while keeping execution systematic.\n",
    "\n",
    "The workflow runs each evening at the CME Globex daily session close — 16:00 Chicago (22:00 UTC in winter, 21:00 UTC in summer) — which is used as the reference since the majority of traded futures are listed there.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Update and Inception Re-Run**\n",
    "\n",
    "Each day, the full futures dataset is ingested from Norgate into Zipline Reloaded. While this isn’t delta-efficient, it's necessary due to how Zipline manages internal state. After ingesting the data, the entire strategy is re-executed from inception to the most recent close. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Trade Extraction and Conversion to IBKR Basket Format**\n",
    "\n",
    "Upon completion, the system parses `transactions.csv` and filters for trades dated to the last bar of the backtest. These trades are treated as actionable signals for the next trading session after particular adjustments.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Validation with Live Market Data and Execution Audit**\n",
    "\n",
    "A report is generated summarizing the trades for next day. Position sizing, rollovers, and price discrepancies are highlighted. Each trade is validated using current IB market data. Volatility and stop distances are recalculated. FX rates are applied where needed. If the limit price deviates by more than ±0.5% from the reference price, the trade is flagged for review. This serves as a final check before submitting the trades to IB.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following sections, we outline the code and logic used to generate the order basket for execution via TWS.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 10.1. Data Update and Inception Re-Run\n",
    "To ensure the backtest includes the most recent market data, the first step in the daily routine is to rebuild the Zipline data bundle. Since Zipline Reloaded doesn’t support partial or incremental ingestion for Norgate futures, the entire dataset must be reprocessed from scratch.\n",
    "\n",
    "This starts by deleting the existing bundle directory (_.zipline/data/norgatedata-full-futures_) using `shutil.rmtree()`. This clears all compiled files and cached data associated with the bundle. After that, running the ingestion step is preferable from an Anaconda Prompt rather than inside the script, since zipline ingest is a command-line tool and can behave more reliably when executed directly in the environment shell: `zipline ingest -b norgatedata-full-futures`."

    "The following routine is responsible for closing live open futures positions held in the Interactive Brokers account. It’s used when we want to enforce a full exit from the market—whether for risk-off scenarios, rollovers or end-of-session flat requirements. The function connects to IB, queries live open positions, cross-references missing exchange fields using the latest Zipline-derived TWS basket, and issues market orders to flatten them.\n",

This file contains all model-generated trades, including the most accurate contract metadata available at signal generation time. From this, it builds a lookup table keyed by (`Symbol`, `Expiry`, `Currency`, `Multiplier`) to resolve missing exchange identifiers later in the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, a custom API client (`IBPositionCloser`) connects to TWS via the IB Python API. Once connected, it requests all current open positions. The wrapper filters for futures contracts only and excludes only positions matching by (`Symbol`, `Expiry`, `Currency`, `Multiplier`) in our `TWS_Basket_*.csv`.\n",
    "\n",
    "After validation, each open position is converted into a market order in the opposite direction. Long positions are closed via SELL market orders. Orders are transmitted one at a time, with a short delay inserted to avoid hitting IB pacing limits. As a quant trader: in thin markets, slippage is a concern; using a limit order with VWAP execution is a reasonable alternative, but it’s not included in this first version.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each close-out is logged to the terminal, including symbol, expiry, currency, exchange, position size, and multiplier. This provides transparency for each action taken and a final opportunity to manually monitor whether positions are being closed as expected."

    "This setup allows daily pricing of international contracts in a uniform risk currency without requiring real-time FX feeds or continuous data streams. It's simple, consistent with the execution timing (post-close), and sufficient for EoD strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we need validation for BUY-side trades before they are executed. The goal is to check that each order still makes sense based on the latest price and volatility data, and that position sizing stays within our predefined risk limits. All checks are run using data pulled directly from Interactive Brokers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process begins by loading the latest model-generated TWS basket and filtering it to keep only BUY orders. These represent new entries into the portfolio. Each contract is then reconstructed using its key identifiers: symbol, expiry, exchange, currency, and multiplier.\n",
    "\n",
    "A connection to IBKR is established using the API, and a 21-day historical price series is requested for each contract using the TRADES feed. Once all data is received, we calculate:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Latest Close Price\n",
    "\n",
    "- 20-day Mean and Standard Deviation\n",
    "\n",
    "- Lower Bollinger Band (BB-Lower-20-3)\n",
    "\n",
    "This gives us the dynamic stop level the models uses to control drawdown. The stop distance is defined as the difference between the current price and the lower Bollinger Band. That value, scaled by the contract’s multiplier, gives the risk per contract in local currency.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before final position sizing, each trade’s native risk is converted to USD using the most recent FX rate (retrieved in the previous step), so all contracts are compared on a like-for-like basis. At the same time, the account’s available USD balance is retrieved through the get_usd_cash_ibapi helper, which connects to IB, collects the cash snapshot, and returns the result. This balance is then used in the validation step to ensure that buy orders stay within the account’s funding and risk limits."

    "The final DataFrame is sorted by symbol and expiry, and written out to a .csv file in the directory used for all IB-bound trade instructions. This file format is directly ingestible by TWS via the Basket Trader interface.

The output is consistent, repeatable, and keeps execution aligned with the model logic.\n",

This ensures we always pick up the latest validated trade basket without hardcoding filenames. After confirming the file, the script reads each row and loops through the orders one by one.\n",

    "For every trade in the file, it builds the contract object and the associated order, then sends it to IB using `placeOrder`. A half-second pause is introduced between each submission to prevent pacing violations and allow enough time for IB to assign order IDs. This approach ensures each order is submitted cleanly, in sequence, and with all required parameters present."
